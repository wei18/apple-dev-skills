description: Use when wiring or debugging launch-the-app XCUITest E2E with Tuist — a native `.uiTests` target needs its own scheme with `testAction: .targets([...])` (adding it to an `.xctestplan` builds but fails with "no test bundles available to test"), named to avoid colliding with an SPM `<Target>UITests` package test target. Also covers driving SwiftUI on macOS, where `element.tap()` throws `point.x != INFINITY` and `app.coordinate(...)` resolves to `(-inf, -inf)` — worked around by anchoring on the window element and clicking finite element frames — plus `hittable` being an invalid NSPredicate key, the sandbox rejecting `/tmp` writes, and locale-stable accessibility queries. Use when asked "why does xcodebuild say no test bundles" or "how do I XCUITest-drive my macOS app".

# Host-Driven XCUITest E2E

"Host-driven" means the test process launches the real app and drives it through the
Simulator or a Mac window via `XCUIApplication` — distinct from unit/snapshot tests, which
never launch a process at all. This is the automated, CI-runnable sibling of
`interactive-simulator-ux-audit`: use that skill to *find* a flow bug by hand, this one to
*pin* it as a regression test.

## When to invoke

- Wiring a first host-driven E2E target in a Tuist-generated project.
- `xcodebuild test` reports "There are no test bundles available to test" for a target that
  otherwise builds cleanly.
- Driving a SwiftUI macOS (AppKit-hosted) window with XCUITest and taps aren't landing.
- Naming a new UI test target and avoiding a collision with an existing package test target.

## Scope

Owns: Tuist scheme/target wiring for native XCUITest targets, and the macOS driving mechanics
below. Does **not** own: manual/interactive Simulator exploration → `interactive-simulator-ux-audit`;
unit/snapshot test framework choice → `swift-testing-baseline`; general navigation architecture
under test → `swiftui-navigation-architecture`.

## Tuist wiring: a dedicated scheme, not a test plan

A Tuist `.uiTests` product target needs **its own scheme** with an explicit
`testAction: .targets([...])` — not membership in an existing scheme's `.xctestplan`.

```swift
// Project.swift
let e2eTarget = Target.target(
    name: "MyAppE2ETests",
    destinations: .iOS,
    product: .uiTests,
    bundleId: "com.example.myapp.e2etests",
    sources: ["E2ETests/**"],
    dependencies: [.target(name: "MyApp")]
)

let e2eScheme = Scheme.scheme(
    name: "MyApp-E2E",
    shared: true,
    buildAction: .buildAction(targets: ["MyApp", "MyAppE2ETests"]),
    testAction: .targets(["MyAppE2ETests"])   // NOT .testPlans([...])
)
```

- Adding a native `.uiTests` target to an *existing* scheme's `.testPlans([...])` builds the
  scheme but produces no `.xctest` bundle for it — `xcodebuild test` then fails with "no test
  bundles available to test". A package's own SPM test targets run fine via a test plan
  because they're cross-linked into the plan's buildables; a same-project native UI test
  target is not. The fix is the dedicated scheme above, not a plan tweak.
- `TestAction`'s factory is `.targets(...)`, not `.testAction(...)`; `TestableTarget` accepts
  a plain string literal target name.
- **Name the target `<App>E2ETests`, not `<App>UITests`**, if the same package already has an
  SPM snapshot/unit target with that suffix (e.g. `MyAppUITests` for snapshot tests) — the two
  would collide.
- Give the E2E target its own build settings (not the app's entitlement-carrying settings) so
  it carries no unintended app capabilities, and keep the E2E scheme's default test action on
  Debug only — it should never be part of a Release archive or the fast default test run.

## Driving SwiftUI on macOS: window-frame anchoring

On native (AppKit-hosted) macOS SwiftUI, the naive APIs don't work:

- `element.tap()` throws `point.x != INFINITY` (`NSInternalInconsistencyException`) — SwiftUI
  exposes no accessibility activation point on macOS the way it does on iOS.
- `app.coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: .zero)` resolves to `(-inf, -inf)` — the application
  element itself has no usable frame to normalize against.

**Working pattern**: element **frames** in the accessibility tree are finite and correct.
Anchor a coordinate on the main window instead of the element, and click by frame:

```swift
let window = app.windows.firstMatch

func click(_ rect: CGRect) {
    let origin = window.frame.origin
    window.coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: .zero)
        .withOffset(CGVector(dx: rect.midX - origin.x, dy: rect.midY - origin.y))
        .tap()
}

click(app.buttons["submit"].frame)
```

Other macOS-driving specifics:

- `hittable` is **not** a valid NSPredicate key in an `XCUIElementQuery` predicate
  (`XCTElementQueryInvalidPredicate` at runtime) — `isHittable` only works as a Swift-side
  property check, never inside a predicate string.
- The test-runner process's sandbox usually can't write to `/tmp`. Dump diagnostic state
  (e.g. `app.debugDescription`) via `print()` so it lands in the `xcodebuild` log directly —
  and don't pipe `xcodebuild` through `tail` or another filter that can drop buffered output
  before the dump is flushed.
- Tapping the *same* element across multiple steps where its accessibility label mutates
  between taps (e.g. a cell whose label changes once filled): capture `element.frame` **once**
  and convert it to an app-relative coordinate up front, rather than re-querying the element
  by its now-stale label on each subsequent tap.
- Test classes that touch `XCUIElement` APIs must be `@MainActor` under Swift 6 strict
  concurrency — those APIs are main-actor-isolated.
- `-only-testing:<Target>/<Class>/<method>` requires all three path segments; a partial path
  silently runs the whole target instead of failing.

## Locale-stable queries

If the app ships more than one locale, query by a **stable accessibility identifier** set in
code (`accessibilityIdentifier("game.completion.hero")`) rather than by visible label text —
translated strings break a hardcoded English-label query the moment a non-English locale runs
the same test. Reserve literal label matching for elements whose text is guaranteed
locale-invariant by design (e.g. digits, or an identifier deliberately not localized).

## Deterministic entry points for hard-to-reach states

A flow that's expensive or unreliable to reach through pure UI interaction (a multi-step win
condition, a rare error state) benefits from a debug-only, launch-argument-gated seam that
deterministically lands the app one step from the state under test, so the test asserts the
*transition*, not the app's own internal logic reproduced via blind taps. Keep this seam
compiled out of Release builds.

## Rationale

A host-driven E2E test is the only automated check that proves the full launch → navigate →
interact → assert path works end-to-end, including scheme/target wiring, entitlements, and
real accessibility tree resolution — none of which a unit or snapshot test exercises. It's
slower and more environment-sensitive than either, which is why it complements rather than
replaces them (see the test pyramid in `swift-testing-baseline`).

## Deviation considerations

- **Cross-package test target** (the UI test target must live in a different SwiftPM package
  than the app target): a dedicated scheme may not resolve the cross-package build graph
  cleanly — an `.xctestplan` referencing both packages' schemes can be the more reliable
  choice there; verify empirically rather than assuming the dedicated-scheme rule always wins.
- **iOS-only app with no macOS target**: skip the window-frame-anchoring section entirely;
  standard `element.tap()` works on iOS.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Adding a native `.uiTests` target to an existing test plan** instead of giving it a
   dedicated scheme — silently produces zero test bundles.
2. **Naming a new E2E target `<App>UITests`** when an SPM snapshot/unit target already uses
   that name — Xcode target collision.
3. **Calling `element.tap()` on macOS** — throws `point.x != INFINITY`; use window-frame
   anchoring instead.
4. **Putting `hittable` in an NSPredicate string** — runtime `XCTElementQueryInvalidPredicate`; use `isHittable` in Swift code.
5. **Re-querying an element by a label that mutates during the test** — capture the frame once, before the label changes.
6. **Matching on visible label text in a localized app** — breaks under any non-English locale; query by accessibility identifier instead.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The E2E target has its own Tuist scheme with `testAction: .targets([...])`, not a `.xctestplan` membership.
- [ ] The E2E target's name doesn't collide with any SPM `<Target>UITests` package target.
- [ ] The E2E scheme is Debug-only and excluded from the Release archive action.
- [ ] macOS taps go through window-frame anchoring, not `element.tap()` / `app.coordinate(...)`.
- [ ] No `hittable` inside an NSPredicate string.
- [ ] Locale-sensitive elements are queried by accessibility identifier, not label text.
- [ ] `-only-testing:` invocations include all three path segments.
- [ ] Any debug-only entry-point seam is compiled out of Release builds.
